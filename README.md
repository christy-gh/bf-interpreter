## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to create a brainfuck interpreter in java, i.e simulate a brainfuck compiler in a java \
program, and explore its possibilities. The program should be able to take in input as a string, either from user input\
or from a file, and output:
- The correct result if possible
- Any errors encountered
- A prompt to the user if the input is nonsensical.

This will be done using the following modules:
- Lexer
- Parser
- Executor
- Transpiler
